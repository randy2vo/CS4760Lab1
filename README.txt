I posted the entire document into chatgpt and have it walk me through it.  

Prompts: 
	"Teach me how to use git repository and add it to my project". 

	"Explain to me what this "x" line of code does".  
 
Summary: The code worked well, I got a better idea of what it's supposed to do.

The project was managed using git. I commited changes at least once per day while working on it. I started by creating a repository and linked the project
with my github account via token key. Every changed I made, I added a comment frequently and pushed it to my github online. To view the commit history logs,
run:
	git log --oneline --decorate --graph

To see what changed in a given commit, run:
	git show <commit_id>
